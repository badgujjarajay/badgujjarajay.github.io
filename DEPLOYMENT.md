# Deployment Instructions

This project is configured to be deployed to GitHub Pages.

## Prerequisites

1.  A GitHub repository.
2.  Node.js installed on your machine.
3.  Git installed and configured.

## Step-by-Step Deployment

1.  **Initialize Git:**
    If you haven't already, initialize a git repository and commit your changes:
    ```bash
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```

2.  **Push to GitHub:**
    Create a new repository on GitHub and push your code:
    ```bash
    git branch -M main
    git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
    git push -u origin main
    ```

3.  **Deploy:**
    Run the deployment script:
    ```bash
    npm run deploy
    ```
    This command builds the project and pushes the `dist` folder to the `gh-pages` branch.

4.  **Configure GitHub Pages:**
    *   Go to your repository settings on GitHub.
    *   Navigate to "Pages".
    *   Ensure the source is set to "Deploy from a branch".
    *   Select the `gh-pages` branch and `/ (root)` folder.
    *   Save.

## Troubleshooting: Blank Page Issue

If your website shows a **blank white screen** after deployment:

1.  **Check the Branch**: ensure you are deploying the `gh-pages` branch, **NOT** the `main` branch.
    *   The `main` branch contains source code (React/JSX) which browsers cannot read.
    *   The `gh-pages` branch contains the built code (HTML/CSS/JS) generated by `npm run deploy`.
    *   Go to **Settings > Pages > Build and deployment > Source** and ensure `gh-pages` is selected.

2.  **Verify Build**:
    *   Run `npm run build` locally. It should create a `dist` folder without errors.
    *   Run `npm run preview` to test the built version locally.

3.  **Correct Base Path**:
    *   This project is configured with `base: './'` in `vite.config.js`. This allows it to work on any path (e.g., `user.github.io/repo/` or `user.github.io/`). You typically do not need to change this.

## Configuration for `BrowserRouter`

This project uses standard anchor links (`#section`) for smooth scrolling, which works perfectly with GitHub Pages out of the box.

If you decide to use `react-router-dom` with `BrowserRouter` in the future:

1.  **Install `react-router-dom`**:
    ```bash
    npm install react-router-dom
    ```

2.  **Use `HashRouter` instead of `BrowserRouter`**:
    GitHub Pages does not support single-page apps with client-side routing (pushState) easily because it returns 404 for unknown paths. `HashRouter` avoids this issue.

    ```jsx
    // src/main.jsx
    import { HashRouter } from 'react-router-dom';

    createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
      <StrictMode>
        <HashRouter>
          <App />
        </HashRouter>
      </StrictMode>,
    )
    ```
